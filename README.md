## Week 1
This week we heard in what team we were in. I was in the team Nicolette. Together with the rest of the team we started to brainstorm some interview questioned. I did some research on who Nicolette is and research her current ways on using the web. She uses speachrecognision software and a drawing tablet no navigate on the web. I experimented around with these for a bit. It was a bit hard to learn the one about speach.

It was very hard to come up with a concept the first day, because we didn't have an interview yet. 

The interview happend and it went well. We had a better picture on what her problems are and how she currently uses the web. Few important insights about the interview:
- Using one click to navigate the web is preferred.
- one keyboard press can be allowed. But not 2 or more.
- No keep pressing buttons
- make clicking area big
- typen van velden gaat vaak via spraak
- selecteren van tekst is heel moeilijk. Selecteerd soms te veel/te weinig tekst
- items verplaatsen naar andere map gaat wel goed
- gebruik geen  hover menu
- ze moet haar content snel en makkelijk kunnen vinden

A few ideas i can come up with are an easier way to select and copy text. Using max of 1 click. I can make a website about nature and make it as easy as possible to navigate through.
