## Week 1
This week we heard in what team we were in. I was in the team Nicolette. Together with the rest of the team we started to brainstorm some interview questioned. I did some research on who Nicolette is and research her current ways on using the web. She uses speech recognition software and a drawing tablet no navigate on the web. I experimented around with these for a bit. It was a bit hard to learn the one about speech.

It was very hard to come up with a concept the first day, because we didn't have an interview yet. 

The interview happened and it went well. We had a better picture on what her problems are and how she currently uses the web. Few important insights about the interview:
- Using one click to navigate the web is preferred.
- one keyboard press can be allowed. But not 2 or more.
- No keep pressing buttons
- make clicking area big
- typing in fields goes through speech software
- selecting text is very hard. Sometimes she selects too much or too little.
- dragging and item to a map goes well
- do not use a hover menu. They are too fast
- She should be able to find her content as fast and easy as possible. 

A few ideas i can come up with are an easier way to select and copy text. Using max of 1 click. I can make a website about nature and make it as easy as possible to navigate through. using big buttons. focussing on content.

## Week 2
I made my first prototype where you can select text with max 2 clicks. Then you get a popup where you can copy the text. After copying you can go to a textarea when clicking on it you get another popup that says paste. Then you have successfully selected, copy and pasted text. This will be tested with Nicolette. 

### The test
The test went well. There are many insight about this test. 
- Copying was really hard. Mostly because the copying start from each character. Sometimes when she used the tablet she would click twice on the same character which would be registered and cause the select to happen on that area. When clicking a different section with a 3rd click it won't work. It caused a bit of confusion.
- There was no feedback given when she selected text. So she clicked the copy button a few times.
- There was a bit of scrolling needed. She couldn't do that with the pen.

Things to do next:
- add more feedback when clicked on a button
- make selections based on words instead of characters
- no scrolling

Extra things
- Make scrolling possible with a click

## Week 3
I made new adjustments to the prototype based on the feedback of last week. 
1. Selections only happens on whole words instead of characters.
2. When the user clicks 2 times on the same word, nothing happens to the selection. You can still copy.
3. I added a hover effect for each word. And when clicked it highlights that specific word.

### The test
The selecting text still didn't work. I couldn't tell why it didn't work, testing it with the trackpad it would work perfectly. But during the test it didn't work with the tablet. Mostly selecting the second word, the entire selection would stop. I plan to thoroughly test my prototype with a tablet this week. The problem might just be the tablet settings. Or it might be dragging accidentally on a word that might cause it. Also i want to add a scroll option.

## Week 4
So i have added an option to scroll and deleted and reinstalled the driver in hopes this might solve the problem with selecting. on top of it, after the feedback session i also added sound as additional feedback after each click. Also added buttons to make text on the screen bigger and smaller, i already made the overall font-size bigger before but maybe she would like a way to customize it herself. The feedback when someone hovers over the text i changed it a bit. When you hover over the text it gives a border, when clicking on a word it fills the background of that word. This might give a better indication if a word has been selected or not. This will be tested.

### The test
The test went very well. Selecting text went very smooth. She was happy with the way it worked. She was only a bit confused when asked to find the copy button. She couldn't find it. She prefers it if the buttons stay at one place so she can find it better. The sound as feedback she liked.
