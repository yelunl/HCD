## Week 1
This week we heard in what team we were in. I was in the team Nicolette. Together with the rest of the team we started to brainstorm some interview questioned. I did some research on who Nicolette is and research her current ways on using the web. She uses speech recognition software and a drawing tablet no navigate on the web. I experimented around with these for a bit. It was a bit hard to learn the one about speech.

It was very hard to come up with a concept the first day, because we didn't have an interview yet. 

The interview happend and it went well. We had a better picture on what her problems are and how she currently uses the web. Few important insights about the interview:
- Using one click to navigate the web is preferred.
- one keyboard press can be allowed. But not 2 or more.
- No keep pressing buttons
- make clicking area big
- typing in fields goes through speach software
- selecting text is very hard. Sometimes she selects too much or too little.
- dragging and item to a map goed well
- do not use a hover menu. They are too fast
- She should be able to find her content as fast and easy as possible. 

A few ideas i can come up with are an easier way to select and copy text. Using max of 1 click. I can make a website about nature and make it as easy as possible to navigate through. using big buttons. focussing on content.
