## Week 1
This week we heard in what team we were in. I was in the team Nicolette. Together with the rest of the team we started to brainstorm some interview questioned. I did some research on who Nicolette is and research her current ways on using the web. She uses speachrecognision software and a drawing tablet no navigate on the web. I experimented around with these for a bit. It was a bit hard to learn the one about speach.

My first idea for a prototype has something to do with nature. I would like to create a drag and drop type of puzzle about birds in the Netherlands/world. I might change the idea later. In the wiki you can find more about my little bit of research in week 1.
